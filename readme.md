# Advent of Code - My First Journey

Hi there!

Welcome to my first attempt at **Advent of Code**! This has been an unforgettable experience, combining the challenge of solving daily coding puzzles with the excitement of learning **Rust**. Each day has been a journey of growth, problem-solving, and discovery.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **Year** 
  - **Day 1**
  - **Day 2**
  - **Day 3**
  - ...and so on, for as long as I can keep up!

I'll be adding solutions daily, so feel free to check back often.

## Reflection

Through this experience, Iâ€™ve learned so many new things. In my opinion, every programmer should try Advent of Code at least once. Itâ€™s a fantastic way to sharpen your skills, explore new programming languages, and enjoy the thrill of solving interesting problems.

### A Personal Note

Iâ€™m proud to say that I solved all the puzzles on my own, without using GPT or any external AI for assistance. Itâ€™s been a challenging but rewarding journey!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸŽ„
